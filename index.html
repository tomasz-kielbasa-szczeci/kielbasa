      <p>
        Czesław Miłosz (1911-2004) was a Polish poet, prose writer, and
        diplomat. Awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1980 for his
        'uncompromising penetration in speaking about the most difficult
        dilemmas of our time'. Born in Lithuania, he survived both Nazi
        occupation and Communist rule, eventually emigrating to the United
        States in 1960.

        <h3>Love</h3>
        <pre>
Love means to learn to look at yourself
The way one looks at distant things
For you are only one thing among many.
And whoever sees that way heals his heart,
Without knowing it, from various ills

        <h3>A Song on the End of the World</h3>
        <pre>
On the day the world ends
A bee circles a clover,
A fisherman mends a glimmering net.
Happy porpoises jump in the sea,
Over the sea a young sparrow soaks up sun.

        <h3>Encounter</h3>
        <pre>
We were riding through frozen fields in a wagon at dawn.
A red wing rose in the darkness.
And suddenly a hare ran across the road.
One of us pointed to it with his hand.
